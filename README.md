## Description
_Note: this project is a work-in-progress._

cda-tools is a repo for the [Collegiate Dancesport Association (CDA)](https://collegiatedancesport.org/) to automate 
[Fair Level Certification (FLC)](https://collegiatedancesport.org/fairlevel/) at circuit dancesport competitions.

These tools aim to streamline the process of validating entries for dancers at member competitions and updating dancers' CDA FLC points after competitions, 
ensuring that dancers' points are verified and updated in a timely manner and that competitions remain fun and fair for dancers of all levels of experience.

## Directory Roadmap
